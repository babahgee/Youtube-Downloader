# Youtube-Downloader (abandoned)

- - -

Youtube-Downloader is a desktop-based, electron made Youtube converter app. It allows users to convert their provided videos into MP3.

The app has a feature to convert multiple video's at the same time, in a queue the can set up. Users can enter the destination path and simply press "convert" and it will show in their destination folder.

### Abandoned project
 
While working on this application, I noticed a few unknown and un-fixable (_yet_) problems that caused the application working slow or not at all. After a while, I decided to give up for now and work on something else.

The app itself does work, only when you build it using the ``electron-packager`` module. The already packaged application sadly does not work.

### Future

Maybe in the future, I will find something revealing itself on my way. Hopefully I will be able to actual complete this project. For now, it's just an abandoned project which is still open-source.

### General details

Modules I used for this.
  - ffmpeg
  - electron
  - express
